# VR_PersonalProject

## Description
VR_PersonalProject is a virtual reality (VR) application that allows users to load and listen to their favorite music in a VR environment. It was developed as part of the amazing VR pathway provided by Unity. This project represents my second room creation, building upon the knowledge acquired during the course. The goal was to create a relaxing VR experience where users can immerse themselves in their music.

## Features
- **Music Loading**: Users can load their favorite music files into the VR application.
- **File Browser**: A file browser interface is implemented using the free Unity asset [Runtime File Browser](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/runtime-file-browser-113006) by yasirkula.
- **Metadata Retrieval**: To obtain metadata for the loaded MP3 files, the project utilizes [TagLIB](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp), an open-source library for reading and editing audio file metadata.
